= Rico Angular Adapter

image:https://travis-ci.org/rico-projects/rico-angular.svg?branch=master["Build Status", link="https://travis-ci.org/rico-projects/rico-angular"]

image:https://nodei.co/npm/rico-angular.png["Rico-Angular on NPM", link="https://www.npmjs.com/package/rico-angular"]


== Usage

You need to have both https://github.com/rico-projects/rico-js[rico-js] and this library as dependency to be able to use this adapter.
This enables you, in case of a bugfix or extension of rico-js to benefit from it without an update in `rico-angular`.

== Example

Please find an example in the https://github.com/rico-projects/rico-samples[rico-samples repository].

== How-To

The following steps describes how you can use Rico in your Angular application.

=== Step 1: Add Dependencies

Add dependencies to `@rico-projects/rico-js` and `rico-angular` to your project:

 npm install @rico-projects/rico-js
 npm install rico-angular

So that these lines end up in your `package.json`:

    "rico-angular": "^1.0.3",
    "@rico-projects/rico-js`": "1.1.0",

=== Step 2: Inject library

Extend the `app.module.ts` by adding the `RicoAngularModule` to the imports:

----
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

import { RicoAngularModule } from 'rico-angular';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    FormsModule,
    RicoAngularModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
----

=== Step 2: Add Code to connect to the Controller   

Inject RicoService and the https://angular.io/api/core/ApplicationRef[ApplicationRef] into your Component you want to use Rico in:

----
constructor(ricoService: RicoService, appRef: ApplicationRef) {
----


Connect to a Rico server endpoint and create an instance of the controller to get access to the model for that you can establish bindings to:

----

 this.ricoService.connect('http://localhost:8080/todo-app/remoting', this.appRef).then(() => {

      this.ricoService.createController('ToDoController').then((controllerProxy) => {
        AppComponent.LOGGER.info('received proxy after createController:', controllerProxy);
        this.appRef.tick();
        this.controllerProxy = controllerProxy;
        this.model = controllerProxy.model;
      }).catch((error) => {
        AppComponent.LOGGER.error(error);
      });

----

=== Step 3: Add code for data binding

As we now have the contoller's model in the component available, we can make use of https://angular.io/api/forms/NgModel[Angular's ngModel] to use that model with our UI.

For example, we can bind a 'newItemText' property of the model to a input field like this (https://github.com/rico-projects/rico-samples/blob/master/todo-list/client-angular/src/app/app.component.html#L17[from rico-samples ToDo list]):

  <input type="text" [(ngModel)]="model.newItemText" (keyup.enter)="addTask()" class="form-control" placeholder="Task">



For a complete working example, please refer to https://github.com/rico-projects/rico-samples/tree/master/todo-list/client-angular[client-angular module] of our https://github.com/rico-projects/rico-samples[ToDo List sample].

=== Run library tests

 npm run test

=== Run library integration tests

Prerequsite: Have https://docs.docker.com/install/[Docker] installed.

Then, have a integration tests server running using Docker:

 npm run start-int-test-server

It will start a docker image with a rico runtime with some remoting controllers mapped to port 8085.

Now *execute tests* with:

 npm run int-test

The tests will watch the source files and re-run upon changes.

Finally, you can stop the integration server with
 
 npm run stop-int-test-server

=== Packaging 

For packaging, the https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng-packagr[ng-packagr] is used via the angular tool chain configuted via `angular.json` file.

== Releases

Releases are done automatically with https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/[semantic-release] when release-triggering commit is added to `master` branch. 

Commits are evaluated by their commit message (thats why we need to stick with the _commit message format_, see "Contributing"). Depending on `fix`, `feat` or `BREAKING CHANGES`, a _Patch_-, _Feature_- or _Breaking_ release is build and released.

A new release is automatically published on NPM and as a release on GitHub.

== Contributing

Please use https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/#commit-message-format[Commit message format] when contributing changes via a PR to this repository. (https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#type[List of commit types to be used])
